  .add64(bidAmount)
  .encrypt();

// 2. Submit to contract
await contract.placeBid(jobId, encrypted.handles[0], encrypted.inputProof);

// 3. Retrieve encrypted result
const encryptedBid = await contract.getBid(jobId, carrier.address);

// 4. Decrypt (only bid owner can decrypt)

## 🔍 Test Patterns Used

### 1. Deployment Fixture Pattern

Clean deployment for each test:

```typescript
async function deployFixture() {
  const factory = await ethers.getContractFactory("PrivateFreightBidding");
  const contract = await factory.deploy();
  const contractAddress = await contract.getAddress();
  return { contract, contractAddress };
}

beforeEach(async function () {
  ({ contract, contractAddress } = await deployFixture());
});
```

### 2. Multi-Signer Pattern

Role separation for testing:

```typescript
type Signers = {
  deployer: HardhatEthersSigner;
  shipper1: HardhatEthersSigner;
  carrier1: HardhatEthersSigner;
  ...
};
```

### 3. Encrypt-Call-Decrypt Pattern

FHE testing workflow:

```typescript
// 1. Encrypt input
const encrypted = await fhevm
  .createEncryptedInput(contractAddress, user.address)
  .add64(value)
  .encrypt();

// 2. Call contract
await contract.method(encrypted.handles[0], encrypted.inputProof);

// 3. Decrypt result
const result = await fhevm.userDecryptEuint(...);
```

### 4. Environment Isolation Pattern

Separate Mock vs Sepolia tests:

```typescript
beforeEach(async function () {
  if (!fhevm.isMock) {
    this.skip(); // Only run on Mock
  }
});
```

```

### Run Specific Test
