## üîê Core Concepts

### FHE-Powered Confidential Freight Booking System

This platform revolutionizes the logistics industry by implementing a **privacy-preserving freight booking system** where:

- **Encrypted Bidding**: All bid prices are encrypted using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), ensuring competitors cannot see each other's pricing strategies
- **Anonymous Competition**: Bidders remain anonymous until the shipper decides to reveal winners
- **Secure Price Discovery**: Market prices are discovered without exposing individual bids during the bidding process
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Smart contracts verify bid validity without revealing sensitive pricing information

### Privacy-First Aviation Ticketing Architecture

The system extends beyond traditional freight to support **confidential flight booking mechanisms**:

- **Private Route Pricing**: Airlines can submit encrypted pricing for routes without revealing competitive information
- **Sealed Bid Auctions**: Passengers and freight forwarders participate in sealed bid auctions for premium routes
- **Confidential Cargo Manifests**: Cargo details remain encrypted while still enabling logistics coordination
- **Anonymous Booking Verification**: Verify booking authenticity without exposing passenger or cargo data

## üéØ Key Features
